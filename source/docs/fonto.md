# Fonto - Font Manager

![Fonto](/omnis-docs/images/plugins/fonto.png)

Fonto is a custom fonts management plugin that will seamlessly integrate with the WordPress editor, allowing you to get right to using your fancy free or premium fonts.

It is built to work with pretty much any configuration font vendors offer (like Typekit, Fonts.com, MyFonts.com, Google Fonts), either by allowing them to serve the fonts via an embed code or by self-hosting the font files.
